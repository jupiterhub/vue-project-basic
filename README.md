# Jupiter's Conclusion
Vue is not a complete framework like Ember and you'd need to rely
on 3rd party libraries for routing/flux/making ajax requests (Axios is recommended).

If you want to get up and running as soon as possible, I would
still recommend Ember as most of the repititve things are automatically taken care of

However, writing in Vue is easy due to it's simple nature of having the styles scripts and html all together in a single Vue page.

Even better, is it's easy to get started with great UI Material designs using Vuetify.

I'm making a port of Super rentals (https://github.com/jupiterhub/super-rentals) using Vue at this point.
